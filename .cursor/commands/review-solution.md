- Ensure configurations follow project conventions
- Remove unnecessary comments
- Verify package categorization is appropriate
- Check for duplicate packages between Nix and Homebrew
- Ensure platform-specific code is in correct locations

- Verify changes work on target platform (macOS/Linux)
- Build configuration to verify it compiles without errors
- Check for build warnings or errors
- Verify package availability in nixpkgs
- Test rollback capability if needed
