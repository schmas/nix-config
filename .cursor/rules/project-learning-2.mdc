- **What goal does it achieve?**
- **What are the main technologies or frameworks used?**

---

## 2. Integrations

  - Is there integration with Google Drive? Slack? Others?
  - What other major integrations exist (e.g., forums, APIs, cloud storage, LLMs, etc.)?
  - Are these integrations already implemented or just planned?

---

## 3. MCP (Model Context Protocol)

- **Does the project provide MCP (Model Context Protocol)?**
  - What features does this MCP deliver?

## 4. Quality Assurance & Monitoring

- **Does the project use Sentry, Datadog, or any similar quality assurance or monitoring tools?**
  - If yes, which ones and how are they integrated?
  - If not, is there any error tracking or monitoring in place?

---

## 5. (Optional) Summary Table
