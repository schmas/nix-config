When working on plans use the following statuses

- analysis: code analysis that can inform new requests/planning or serve as standalone analysis
- requests: initial context to create a plan with
- planning: requests that have clarity, planning is in progress to define the task
- in-progress: the current task thats in progress, should be only 1 in most cases
- done: completed tasks
- on-hold: tasks that may restart
- canceled: requests or plans that are stopped with no intention to restart

Guidelines

- track plans in `.tasks`
- **ALWAYS MOVE files** between status directories - never copy or duplicate them
- move files to sub-directory applicable to the status (e.g. move to `.tasks/in-progress` when code changes start)
- all task files must be prefixed with a sequence ID (4 hex chars) from `.tasks/.sequence`
- when creating new task files: read `.tasks/.sequence`, increment the hex value, update the file, and prefix the filename with the new ID

Task Flow Example

A task file `0011-xxxx.md` follows this progression:

1. Starts in `.tasks/analysis` or `.tasks/requests`
2. Move to `.tasks/planning` when planning begins
3. Move to `.tasks/in-progress` when code changes start
4. Move to `.tasks/done` only when:
   - User explicitly asks to mark it as done
   - Agent asks user for confirmation and user approves
   - User manually moves it
